# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-based-on-opencv

The project built in 2019 in order to learn machine vision and front-end UI construction, based on opencv and Qt, there are three modes, game recognition, man-machine battle and Go recognition (in the process of updating...)

1. The first is by turning on the camera to monitor the chessboard and pieces in real time, so that the chess game can be displayed on the host computer, the process can be recorded, and the winner can be automatically judged

2. The second connotation has simple, medium, and difficult 3 modes

4. The third type can only identify the chessboard and pieces, but cannot judge the outcome....

**In order to make the project more convincing, I uploaded a real machine demonstration video**
